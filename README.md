# KodeCamp DevOps Lifecycle â€“ KodeCamp 5.0

This repository contains a concise breakdown of the **DevOps Lifecycle** as part of the **KodeCamp 5.0 DevOps Track**.

## About DevOps
**DevOps** is a culture and practice that unifies software development and IT operations. It promotes shorter development cycles, increased deployment frequency, and more dependable releases.

### Core Principles
- Collaboration between Dev and Ops teams  
- Automation of build, test, and deployment  
- Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)  
- Monitoring and feedback loops  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## DevOps Lifecycle Stages
- **Planning:** Define goals and track tasks collaboratively  
- **Development:** Write and manage code in small iterations  
- **Building:** Compile and package code using automation tools  
- **Testing:** Validate code through automated/manual testing  
- **Release:** Finalize and approve builds for deployment  
- **Deployment:** Push updates to production environments  
- **Operations:** Manage live system stability and performance  
- **Monitoring:** Observe system health and user feedback
